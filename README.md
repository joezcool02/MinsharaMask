Change Detection in Live Video for Processing

##What is Processing?
Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. You can download it [HERE](https://processing.org/download/). You will need this to run this project.

##Downloading this Project
For Developers, simply clone it as you would normally.
If this is your first time using Git, then you can download the .zip as follows. See the image below if needed. Click on the green button which says "Clone or download" at the top of this page, then click "Download ZIP". ![enter image description here](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/DownloadZip2.jpg)

You will then need to unzip this project file.
You will then need to move this unzipped folder into Documents/Processing to access it in Processing.
You will need to add a Video folder inside data with two videos (you probably shouldn't have to do this I will try to fix it)

##Adding Libraries
In order to run this project you will need to install some libraries.

In the toolbar go into Sketch/Import Library/Add Library 
search for OpenCV and install "OpenCV for Processing".

After doing this the project should run, feel free to go into the Issues section of Github and create a new issue if something goes wrong.
