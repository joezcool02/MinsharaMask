\chapter{My Life 19/12/1931}
Audrey Jean Elliott(Weeks)

I was born in a nursing home in Dalston???. mum was ????? to St Marys Hospital High ???. as develops breast abcess and was in hospital for a few months. we lived in Balmes road Hackney N.
The neighbours next door, mr and mrs Golledge (the aunty Julie; Uncle Bert) took me from the hospitals as we had no relatives in london and had not been there long. They bought all my needs, cot,pram, clothes and looked after me ( they had no children), they were a wonderful couple and adored me.
When Mum came out of Hospital I was about 3 months old, so it was difficult for me to adjust to my mother.
We moved to several other flats around the highway area. The last was AVENHALL??? road, route if Arsenal football ground you could watch matches from the Scullery Window.
I want to a nursing school there, but we then moved to IGO bonnet.
I remember my first impression of Barnet when we were viewing houses.
We stood at the top of Manor road and overlooked fields (In view with 7 tree stumps nicknamed 7 sisters).I loved it. I couldn't wait to move. We looked at 5 houses. But liked 1 Brookside Close best. All new houses,then were mostly all moved in by railmen??? (nicknamed - bluebottle valley) I was 5 and a half. We moved in. I had a lovely room with electric lights and a gas cooker(We always had gas manres??? to cook in london). The back garden was still here a fields the grass taller than me. but Dad had his first maintain gradening with my help we both liked it and soon had a flower. I loved a vey ???.
